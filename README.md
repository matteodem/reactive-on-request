#Reactive on Request

Imagine yourself reading through a comment. While you're still busy with reading,
the comment suddenly disappears. The comment has been voted up which causes the
reactivity to push it to the top, since the sorting order is defined like that.

Most of the time reactivity comes in handy but at times like this it would
most certainly confuse people and not be of any advantage. That's what this
package is for.
